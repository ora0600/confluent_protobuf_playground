# How to find the best strategy

Confluent Documentation ([Platform](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/fundamentals/schema-evolution.html) / [Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/sr/index.html)) is describing the fact - the what - and not the how to do this.
I will try to bring everything together.

## Introduction

Schema evolution refers to the process of making changes to a database schema over time as the requirements of an application or system evolve. This could involve adding new fields, modifying existing ones, or even removing outdated components.

Finding the best compatibility method depends on various factors, including the specific database system being used, the nature of the changes being made, and the impact those changes will have on existing data and applications. 
Some common compatibility methods include:

* **Backward compatibility**: Ensuring that new schema changes are compatible with older versions of the application or database, allowing existing data and systems to continue functioning without interruption.
* **Forward compatibility**: Making sure that older versions of the application or database can still function properly with newer versions of the schema, allowing for smooth upgrades without breaking existing functionality.
* **Versioning**: Implementing a versioning system that tracks changes to the schema over time, allowing for multiple versions of the schema to coexist and ensuring compatibility between different versions of the application and database. The is then the schema registry.
* **Data migration**: When significant changes to the schema are necessary, migrating existing data to conform to the new schema structure while preserving integrity and minimizing disruption to the system.

Choosing the best compatibility method often requires careful consideration of the specific requirements and constraints of the system, as well as collaboration between database administrators, developers, and other stakeholders.

## Example: What could be a best example for Strategy finding

One example of a best strategy for schema evolution could be employing backward compatibility combined with versioning. Here's how it could work:

* **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure that any new schema changes are backward compatible with older versions of the application or database. This means that existing data and systems can continue to function without interruption even after the schema has been updated. This strategy helps prevent disruptions to ongoing operations and user experiences.
* **Versioning**: Implement a versioning system that tracks changes to the schema over time. Each new version of the schema should be clearly documented, and changes should be carefully managed to avoid conflicts or inconsistencies. Versioning allows for multiple versions of the schema to coexist, making it easier to manage transitions between different versions of the application or database.

By combining **backward compatibility with versioning**, you can ensure that schema evolution is managed effectively while minimizing disruptions to existing systems and data. This approach provides flexibility for making changes as needed while maintaining the integrity and stability of the overall system.

## The Full method

The "**Full**" method in the context of schema evolution typically refers to a strategy where backward and forward compatibility are both maintained simultaneously. This approach aims to ensure that new versions of the schema are compatible with both older and newer versions of the application or database.

In the Full method:

* **Backward Compatibility**: New schema changes are designed to be compatible with older versions of the application or database, allowing existing data and systems to continue functioning without disruption.
* **Forward Compatibility**: Similarly, changes are also made with consideration for future versions of the application or database, ensuring that older versions can seamlessly interact with newer versions of the schema.

By implementing the Full method, organizations can maintain flexibility and stability in their systems, accommodating both current and future needs without sacrificing compatibility or data integrity.

### What are the pitfalls of Full method?

While the "**Full**" method of schema evolution offers many benefits, there are still **potential pitfalls** to consider:

* **Complexity**: Managing backward and forward compatibility simultaneously can increase the complexity of schema design and implementation. It requires careful planning and coordination to ensure that changes are compatible across different versions of the application or database. It is never a good idea to let the developer alone. Schema Management should be a central task
* **Performance Overhead**: Maintaining compatibility with multiple schema versions can introduce performance overhead, especially in systems with large datasets or complex queries. Each additional layer of compatibility may require extra processing or data manipulation, potentially impacting performance.
* **Increased Development Time**: Developing and testing changes to support both backward and forward compatibility can require more time and resources compared to simpler compatibility strategies. This may slow down the pace of development and deployment for new features or updates.
* **Potential for Bugs and Errors**: The complexity of managing compatibility across multiple schema versions increases the risk of introducing bugs or errors. Even with thorough testing, it can be challenging to anticipate and mitigate all possible compatibility issues.
* **Limited Flexibility**: Striving for full compatibility with both older and newer versions of the schema may limit the flexibility of schema changes. Some modifications may be more difficult to implement without breaking compatibility, leading to compromises in design or functionality.

Despite these potential pitfalls, the Full method can still be a valuable approach for organizations that prioritize stability and compatibility in their systems. It requires careful consideration of trade-offs and diligent management to mitigate risks effectively.

## Advantages of backward compared with Full method

the advantages of the **backward compatibility** approach compared to the **full compatibility method** include:

1. **Simplicity**: Backward compatibility focuses solely on ensuring that new schema changes are compatible with older versions of the application or database. This simplicity can make it easier to design, implement, and maintain schema changes, reducing complexity and potential points of failure.
2. **Faster Development**: With a narrower focus on backward compatibility, developers can often implement schema changes more quickly compared to the full compatibility method. This can accelerate the pace of development and deployment for new features or updates.
3. **Lower Performance Overhead**: By prioritizing compatibility with older versions only, backward compatibility may incur lower performance overhead compared to the full compatibility method. This can result in better system performance, especially in environments with large datasets or complex queries.
4. **Clearer Version Management**: Backward compatibility ensures that older versions of the application or database can seamlessly interact with newer versions of the schema. This can simplify version management and deployment processes, as there is a clear distinction between compatible and incompatible versions.
5. **Greater Flexibility for Changes**: Backward compatibility allows for more flexibility in making schema changes, as developers can focus on meeting the needs of current users without being constrained by the requirements of future versions. This can lead to more agile development practices and quicker iterations.

Overall, backward compatibility offers a streamlined approach to managing schema evolution, prioritizing simplicity, speed, and flexibility. However, it may not be suitable for all situations, particularly those where compatibility with future versions is a critical consideration.

## List of best methods for specific pattern

While there isn't a one-size-fits-all list of which compatibility method fits best for specific patterns, here are some general guidelines:

1. **Backward Compatibility**:
Best suited for environments where maintaining compatibility with older versions of the application or database is critical.
Ideal for situations where simplicity, speed of development, and minimal performance overhead are priorities.
Suitable for applications with stable user bases and a focus on backward compatibility guarantees.
2. **Full Compatibility**:
Well-suited for environments where both backward and forward compatibility are equally important.
Useful in scenarios where the system needs to support interactions between multiple versions of the application or database concurrently.
Appropriate for applications with rapidly evolving requirements and frequent updates, where maintaining compatibility with both older and newer versions is essential.
3. **Partial Compatibility (a hybrid approach)**:
Can be a good compromise in situations where full compatibility is not feasible or necessary but backward compatibility alone is insufficient.
Allows for flexibility in managing compatibility requirements based on the specific needs of the application or database.
May involve implementing backward compatibility for critical components while accepting some limitations on forward compatibility for less critical features.

Ultimately, the choice of compatibility method depends on various factors, including the specific requirements, constraints, and priorities of the system being developed or maintained. It's essential to carefully evaluate these factors and choose the method or combination of methods that best align with the goals and objectives of the project.

### Method for change data capturing

For **Change Data Capture (CDC)**, where capturing and propagating changes in a database is crucial, a compatibility method that ensures both backward and forward compatibility is typically preferred. This often aligns with the **Full compatibility** method. Here's why:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: It's essential to ensure that new schema changes made for CDC purposes are compatible with older versions of the application or database. This allows existing data and systems to continue functioning without interruption.

2. **Forward Compatibility**: Similarly, changes should also consider compatibility with future versions of the application or database. This ensures that older versions can seamlessly interact with newer versions of the schema, maintaining the integrity and continuity of data propagation.

3. **Versioning**: Implementing a versioning system alongside CDC helps track changes to the schema over time. This provides a clear history of modifications and facilitates the management of different schema versions, ensuring smooth transitions between versions.

By employing the **Full compatibility method** for CDC, organizations can effectively manage schema evolution while ensuring data consistency, compatibility, and integrity across different versions of the application or database. This approach is particularly important in environments where capturing and propagating changes accurately and reliably are critical requirements.

## Method for Event Sourcing 

For **Event Sourcing**, which involves capturing and storing all changes to the application's state as a sequence of events, the compatibility method depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the system. However, the **Full compatibility method** is often well-suited for Event Sourcing, for similar reasons as with Change Data Capture (CDC):

1. Backward Compatibility: New schema changes should be backward compatible to ensure that existing events can be replayed accurately, even after schema modifications. This allows for seamless querying and reconstruction of past states from the event log.

2. Forward Compatibility: Changes should also consider forward compatibility to ensure that older events can still be interpreted correctly with newer versions of the schema. This ensures that the event log remains interpretable and usable as the schema evolves over time.

3. Versioning: Implementing a versioning system is beneficial for tracking changes to the event schema over time. This helps manage different versions of the event schema and ensures compatibility between different versions of the application that may be producing or consuming events.

By employing the Full compatibility method for Event Sourcing, organizations can maintain the integrity and consistency of event data while allowing for flexible schema evolution. This approach ensures that historical events remain interpretable and usable, even as the schema evolves to meet changing requirements.

## Method for IoT

For **Internet of Things (IoT)** applications, the choice of compatibility method depends on various factors, including the nature of the IoT devices, the requirements of the system, and the constraints of the environment. However, a combination of **backward compatibility** and versioning is often well-suited for IoT scenarios:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensuring that new schema changes are backward compatible with older versions of the IoT devices and systems is crucial. This allows existing devices to continue operating seamlessly even after schema updates, preventing disruptions to IoT data collection and processing.
2. **Versioning**: Implementing a versioning system helps track changes to the schema over time, particularly important in IoT environments where devices may have varying capabilities and firmware versions. Versioning facilitates the management of different schema versions and ensures compatibility between devices with different firmware versions.

By combining backward compatibility with versioning, organizations can effectively manage schema evolution in IoT applications, ensuring compatibility with existing devices while accommodating the introduction of new features and improvements over time. This approach helps maintain the stability, reliability, and interoperability of IoT systems in dynamic and evolving environments.

## Method for Microservices

For **Microservices** architecture, where applications are composed of small, independently deployable services, managing schema evolution is crucial to maintain compatibility and interoperability between services. The best compatibility method for microservices often involves a combination of backward compatibility, forward compatibility, and versioning:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Each service should strive to maintain backward compatibility with older versions of its API and data schema. This allows existing clients to continue functioning without modification, even as the service evolves and introduces new features or changes to its schema.
2. **Forward Compatibility**: Services should also consider forward compatibility to ensure that newer versions of the service can interact seamlessly with older clients. This allows for smooth upgrades and deployments without requiring all clients to be updated simultaneously.
3. **Versioning**: Implementing versioning mechanisms for service APIs and data schemas is essential to manage changes over time. This typically involves including version identifiers in API endpoints or data formats and providing clear documentation for clients to understand version compatibility and migration paths.

By combining these compatibility methods, microservices architectures can achieve flexibility and agility while minimizing disruptions caused by schema changes. This approach enables independent development, deployment, and evolution of services while ensuring compatibility and interoperability across the system. Additionally, adopting standards and best practices for schema evolution, such as using semantic versioning and providing comprehensive documentation, can further enhance the management of compatibility in microservices architectures.

## Method for AI cases

For **AI** systems, managing schema evolution depends on the specific context and use case of the AI application. However, similar to other software systems, a combination of backward compatibility, forward compatibility, and versioning can be valuable:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: AI models and data formats should aim to maintain backward compatibility to ensure that existing deployments and integrations can continue to function effectively. This is particularly important in AI systems where models are trained on historical data and deployed in production environments.
2. **Forward Compatibility**: Considering forward compatibility ensures that newer versions of AI models or data formats can still be used with older versions of the application or downstream systems. This helps future-proof AI systems and allows for seamless upgrades without requiring immediate updates to all components.
3. **Versioning**: Implementing versioning mechanisms for AI models, datasets, and APIs helps track changes over time and manage compatibility between different versions. Versioning facilitates the deployment of new models, the evaluation of model performance over time, and the management of dependencies between AI components.

Additionally, AI systems often require careful validation and testing procedures to ensure that changes to models or data schemas do not introduce unintended consequences or degrade performance. Continuous monitoring and feedback loops are also essential for detecting and addressing compatibility issues as they arise in production environments.

Overall, adopting a comprehensive approach to schema evolution in AI systems helps ensure stability, reliability, and interoperability while enabling ongoing innovation and improvement in AI applications.

## Other event pattern with best method

Here are a few more event-driven patterns along with the best compatibility method for each:

1. **Publish/Subscribe Pattern**:
Best Method: **Full Compatibility**
Reasoning: Since publishers and subscribers may evolve independently, it's crucial to ensure compatibility both backward and forward to maintain seamless communication between components.
2. **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**:
Best Method: **Partial Compatibility**
Reasoning: CQRS often involves separating read and write operations, allowing for different schemas for commands and queries. While backward compatibility may be necessary for queries, forward compatibility may be more important for commands to introduce new functionalities.
3. **Transactional Outbox Pattern**:
Best Method: **Full Compatibility**
Reasoning: Ensuring compatibility both backward and forward is essential to maintain consistency between the transactional data and the outbox, allowing for reliable event publishing and consumption.
3. **Event Sourcing with CQRS**:
Best Method: **Full Compatibility**
Reasoning: Given the complexity of capturing and storing all changes as events, while also separating read and write operations, maintaining full compatibility ensures consistency and interoperability between the event store, command model, and query model.
4. **Saga Pattern**:
Best Method: **Full Compatibility**
Reasoning: Sagas coordinate multiple distributed transactions to achieve a consistent outcome. Full compatibility ensures that each step of the saga can evolve independently while maintaining compatibility with past and future steps.
5. **Event-Driven Microservices Architecture**:
Best Method: **Full Compatibility**
Reasoning: Each microservice may produce and consume events independently, making full compatibility essential to ensure seamless communication and interoperability between services as they evolve over time.

In summary, the best compatibility method for event-driven patterns depends on the specific requirements and constraints of each pattern, but ensuring compatibility both backward and forward is generally beneficial for maintaining stability, reliability, and interoperability in event-driven systems.

## Confusion: Best fit is FULL, but complex?

With Full method you need best development principles to overcome pitfalls (mentioned above).
If you're looking for a simple and effective approach that also aligns with best practices, focusing on backward compatibility can be a solid choice.

Backward Compatibility:

* Simplicity: Backward compatibility is simpler to implement and manage compared to the full compatibility method.
* Effectiveness: It ensures that new schema changes are compatible with older versions of the application or system, allowing for seamless transitions and minimizing disruptions.
* Stability: By prioritizing compatibility with existing components, backward compatibility helps maintain stability and reliability in the system.
* Clarity: It provides clear guidelines for managing schema evolution, making it easier for developers to understand and follow.

While full compatibility may offer more flexibility in certain situations, backward compatibility provides a straightforward and reliable approach that meets the needs of many systems without introducing unnecessary complexity.

## Implementation principles for Backward as an example

To design implementation principles for managing schema evolution with a focus on backward compatibility, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Versioning**: Implement a versioning mechanism for schemas, APIs, and data formats to track changes over time. Use clear version identifiers and semantic versioning to communicate compatibility and migration paths effectively. Here: **Schema Registry**
2. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for schema changes, including release notes, migration guides, and compatibility matrices. Ensure that developers, users, and other stakeholders have access to up-to-date information about schema evolution and compatibility requirements. Here. ** Schema Registry, with Tags (metadata, Business)**
3. **Testing**: Develop robust testing strategies to verify backward compatibility before deploying schema changes. Implement automated tests to detect regressions and ensure that existing functionality remains intact after schema modifications. Here: You can use this playground for testing.
4. **Deprecation Policies**: Define clear deprecation policies for outdated schema versions, APIs, and data formats. Communicate deprecation timelines and migration paths to users and stakeholders to facilitate smooth transitions to newer versions.
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Design systems to gracefully handle compatibility issues with older schema versions. Provide fallback mechanisms, error handling strategies, or backward compatibility layers to ensure that older clients can still interact with newer versions of the system.
6. **Feedback Loops**: Establish feedback loops to gather input from users, developers, and other stakeholders about schema changes and compatibility issues. Use this feedback to refine implementation principles, address pain points, and improve the overall schema evolution process.
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously evaluate and refine implementation principles based on feedback, lessons learned, and evolving requirements. Incorporate best practices and emerging technologies to enhance schema evolution capabilities and ensure long-term sustainability.

By following these implementation principles, you can design a robust schema evolution strategy that prioritizes backward compatibility while promoting stability, reliability, and interoperability in your systems. This is central management task and should not be managed by individual developers alone.

## Example: test plan to find out which method would fit best

To determine which schema evolution method best fits your specific case, you can create a test plan that includes the following steps:

1. **Define Requirements**: Clearly outline the requirements and constraints of your system, including the types of schema changes expected, the impact on existing components, and the desired level of compatibility (e.g., backward, forward, or full).
2. **Identify Use Cases**: Identify representative use cases or scenarios that involve schema evolution, such as adding new fields, modifying existing ones, or deprecating outdated components. These use cases will serve as the basis for testing different compatibility methods.
3. **Select Test Data**: Choose appropriate test data sets that reflect real-world scenarios and cover a range of data formats, structures, and complexities. Ensure that the test data includes examples of both current and potential future schema versions.
4. **Implement Test Cases**: Develop test cases for each use case identified in step 2, focusing on evaluating the compatibility of schema changes with existing components and data. Define specific criteria for assessing backward compatibility, forward compatibility, and overall system behavior.
5. **Execute Test Cases**: Execute the test cases against your system using the selected test data sets. Record the results of each test, including any compatibility issues, errors, or unexpected behaviors encountered during testing.
6. **Analyze Results**: Analyze the test results to evaluate the effectiveness of each compatibility method in meeting the requirements and constraints of your system. Consider factors such as simplicity, flexibility, performance, and overall impact on system stability and reliability.
7. **Iterate and Refine**: Based on the test results and analysis, iterate on your schema evolution strategy and refine the implementation principles as needed. Consider adjusting the test plan or incorporating additional test cases to further validate the chosen compatibility method.
8. ** Document Findings**: Document the findings of the test plan, including key observations, lessons learned, and recommendations for future schema evolution efforts. Share the results with stakeholders to facilitate informed decision-making and consensus on the chosen compatibility method.

By following this test plan, you can systematically evaluate different schema evolution methods and determine which one best meets the specific needs and objectives of your system.

### Here is an example of testing/analysing

Let's consider a sample case for a web application that manages user profiles. The application currently stores user information such as username, favorite number, and favorite color. The goal is to add a new field for storing the user's phone number while ensuring compatibility with existing user data and functionalities.

Here's a simplified test plan for evaluating different compatibility methods in this scenario:

1. **Define Requirements**:
Add a new **"phone number"** field to the user profile schema.
Ensure compatibility with existing user data and functionalities.
Minimize disruption to the user experience and application functionality.
2. **Identify Use Cases**:
Use Case 1: Add a phone number for a new user during **registration**.
Use Case 2: Display the phone number in the user **profile page** for existing users.
Use Case 3: Allow existing users to **update their phone number**.
Use Case 4: Ensure that existing functionalities such as **login, password reset, and user search are not affected by the schema change**.
3. **Select Test Data**:
Test data sets include existing user profiles with various combinations of username, favorite number, and color.
Additional test data includes sample phone numbers in different formats (e.g., with or without country code, with or without dashes).
4. **Implement Test Cases**:
Test Case 1: Register a new user with a phone number and verify that the data is stored correctly.
Test Case 2: Display the phone number in the user profile page and verify that existing user data (username, email, date of birth) is still displayed correctly.
Test Case 3: Allow an existing user to update their phone number and verify that the update is applied without affecting other user data.
Test Case 4: Perform functional testing for existing functionalities (login, password reset, user search) to ensure they continue to work as expected after the schema change.
5. **Execute Test Cases**:
Execute each test case against the web application using the selected test data sets.
Record the results of each test, including any compatibility issues or unexpected behaviors encountered.
6. **Analyze Results**:
Analyze the test results to evaluate the effectiveness of each compatibility method (backward, full, etc.) in meeting the requirements and constraints of the system.
Consider factors such as simplicity, flexibility, performance, and overall impact on system stability and reliability.
7. **Iterate and Refine**:
Based on the test results and analysis, iterate on the schema evolution strategy and refine the implementation principles as needed.
Consider adjusting the test plan or incorporating additional test cases to further validate the chosen compatibility method.
8. **Document Findings**:
Document the findings of the test plan, including key observations, lessons learned, and recommendations for future schema evolution efforts.
Share the results with stakeholders to facilitate informed decision-making and consensus on the chosen compatibility method.

By following this sample test plan, you can systematically evaluate different compatibility methods for schema evolution in your web application and determine the best approach for adding new fields while maintaining compatibility with existing data and functionalities.


# Central Schema Management

In general, it's typically better to **centrally manage schemas** using a schema registry rather than adding schemas directly from the producer. Here's why:

1. Centralized Management: Using a schema registry allows for centralized management of schemas across different producers and consumers. This makes it easier to ensure consistency and compatibility across your data pipeline.
2. Schema Evolution: Centralized schema management simplifies schema evolution. When schemas evolve over time, you can register new versions in the schema registry and update producers and consumers to use the latest compatible schema version. This helps maintain backward compatibility and ensures smooth data flow.
3. Schema Validation: Schema registries often provide schema validation capabilities, ensuring that only valid schemas are registered. This helps prevent issues caused by invalid or incompatible schemas being used in the data pipeline.
4. Versioning and Compatibility: Schema registries typically support versioning of schemas, allowing you to track changes over time and ensure compatibility between different versions of schemas. This is important for handling rolling updates and maintaining compatibility with existing data.
5. Separation of Concerns: Centralized schema management promotes separation of concerns by decoupling schema definition and usage from individual producers and consumers. This makes it easier to maintain and scale your data pipeline as it grows and evolves.

While it's possible to add schemas directly from the producer, this approach can lead to fragmentation, inconsistency, and potential compatibility issues across the data pipeline. Therefore, it's generally considered a best practice to use a schema registry for centralized schema management in Kafka-based systems.

# Oragnization Setup for Schema Management
